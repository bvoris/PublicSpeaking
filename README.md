Cyber Warnings E-Magazine - How Windows Active Directory is the root cause of many logon security headaches<BR />

"Brad Voris also comments on the inflexibility of group logs, saying: “Audit logs are in the form of event logs with specific error messages, some of which require Group Policy configuration changes on the Domain Controller Default Policy.
